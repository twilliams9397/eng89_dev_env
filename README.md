```
- Let's `ssh` into our vm and launch nginx web-server
- use `apt-get` package manager in Linux - for mac `homebrew` or only `brew`
- `apt-get` is used to install and uninstall any packages needed
- To use the command in `admin` mode we can use `sudo` before the command
- `sudo apt-get upgrade -y`
- `sudo apt-get update -y`
- `ping www.bbc.co.uk`
- `sudo apt-get install name_of_the_package` 
- To work in an `admin mode` at all times (not recommonded) `sudo -su` and you'll land in admin mode
- We will install nginx in our guest machine/VM/ubuntu 16.04
- launch the default nginx page in host machine's browser
- To come out of your VM `exit`
- install nginx `sudo apt-get install nginx -y`
- checking status of nginx ` systemctl status nginx` 
- or restrat ` systemctl restart nginx` or just to start ` systemctl start nginx` 



- step 1: Install the plugin `vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater`
- step 2: vagrant destroy
- step 3: add this line of code into Vagrantfile `config.hostsupdater.aliases = ["development.local"]`
- step 4: vagrant up
- step 5: vagrant ssh
- step 6: repeat all the update and upgrade commands followed by installing nginx and checking of nginx
- `ningx status active` should load nginx in the browswer with `192.168.10.100` as well as `http://development.local/`

- if the `http://development.local/` doesn't work then try following debugging steps
- open a new `Gitbash termial` as `admin`
- `vagrant destroy`
- `rm -rf .vagrant`
- `vagrant up`

- Just in case if still doesn't work then try:
- `vagrant plugin uninstall vagrant-hostsupdater`
- update plugin with `vagrant plugin update vagrant-hostsupdater`
- open a new `Gitbash termial` as `admin`
- `vagrant destroy`
- `rm -rf .vagrant`
- `vagrant up`

#### Restart your machine after installing or updating the plugin

- if your machine isn't accepting the plugin and you can see nginx default page on `192.168.10.100` its fine for now
- Push your progress by 14:00 and share your repos please.
